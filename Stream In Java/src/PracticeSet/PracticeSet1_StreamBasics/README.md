# Practice Set 1: Stream Fundamentals

**Goal:** Build confidence with core stream operations: creation, map, filter, distinct, limit, skip, short-circuiting.

## Tasks
1. Create streams from collections, arrays, and ranges; show lazy evaluation by logging.
2. Implement a pipeline that filters even numbers, squares them, limits to 5, and collects to a list.
3. Demonstrate `findFirst` vs `findAny` on ordered vs unordered streams.
4. Show `distinct` + `sorted` to build a canonical vocabulary from sentences.
5. Compare `skip`/`limit` vs `takeWhile`/`dropWhile` on ordered data.

## Requirements
- Use pure lambdas; avoid side effects.
- Demonstrate ordering effects explicitly.
- Include a runnable `main` in `Solution.java` with printed outputs.
- Keep solutions deterministic (no randomness).
