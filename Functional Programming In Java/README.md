## Chapter 1: Introduction to Functional Programming
- **Why Use Functional Programming?**
  - Promotes immutability, statelessness, and easier reasoning about code.
  - Reduces side effects and improves testability.
- **Declarative Programming**
  - Focuses on what to do, not how to do it.
  - Example: Using `Stream` API for data processing.
- **Immutability**
  - Data cannot be changed after creation.
  - Example: Using `final` variables and immutable collections.
- **Examples:**
  - Pure functions, stateless computations, and simple lambda expressions.

## Chapter 2: Core Concepts of Functional Programming
- **Immutability**
- **Functional Purity**
- **First-Class Functions**
- **Examples:**
  - Functions as values, pure/impure function comparison, and immutable data structures.

## Chapter 3: The Function Interface in Functional Programming
- **Function<T, R> Interface**
  - Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
- **Examples:**
  - Mapping, chaining, and composing functions.

## Chapter 4: Lambda Expressions
- **Syntax and Usage**
- **Benefits**
- **Examples:**
  - Inline function definitions, event handling, and concise code.

## Chapter 5: BiFunctions and Beyond
- **BiFunction<T, U, R> Interface**
  - Functions with two arguments.
- **Other Functional Interfaces:**
  - Predicate, Consumer, Supplier, UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator.
- **Examples:**
  - Combining, filtering, and transforming data with multiple arguments.

## Chapter 6: The Functions as Data
- **Functions as First-Class Citizens**
- **Storing Functions in Variables and Collections**
- **Passing and Returning Functions**
- **Examples:**
  - Assigning lambdas to variables, storing in lists, and returning functions from methods.

## Chapter 7: Passing Functions as Arguments
- **Higher-Order Functions**
- **Using Built-in and Custom Functional Interfaces**
- **Examples:**
  - Passing `Function`, `Predicate`, `Consumer`, and custom interfaces as arguments.

## Chapter 8: Returning Functions
- **Returning Functions from Methods**
- **Closures and Captured Variables**
- **Examples:**
  - Factory methods, dynamic function generation, and nested suppliers.

## Chapter 9: Closures
- **Definition and Use Cases**
- **Capturing Local Variables**
- **Mutable and Effectively Final Variables**
- **Examples:**
  - Lambdas capturing state, mutable closures, and anonymous inner classes.

## Chapter 10: Higher-Order Functions
- **Definition and Power**
- **Map, Filter, Reduce Patterns**
- **Function Composition**
- **Examples:**
  - Implementing map/filter, composing functions, and dynamic predicate generation.
